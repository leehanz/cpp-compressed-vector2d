## Motivation – cons of vector of vectors

Using a vector of vectors:

1. Is inefficient in terms of memory allocation and deallocation, due to multiple blocks being allocated. (memory fragmentation)​.

2. It might be cache-unfriendly (C lib cache) as the underlying data of sub vectors are stored in dynamically allocated and discontinuous blocks of memory.

3. It could produce memory fragmentation more easily.

## Flattened Data of ollib::vector2d
The inner class Row holds the actual index and size of the elements in the data buffer.
|   Row 1    |   Row 2   |   Row 3    |   ...
All elements are stored in a continuous buffer.

## Behavior of vector2d::push_back
Before row[0].push_back():
Row 0 (0-3)  Row 1 (4-6)
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 

After row[0].push_back():
garbage(0-3)  Row 1 (4-6)  Row 0 (7-11)
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 

## Garbage generation

The garbage are generated by the following operations:

- vector2d:
-- erase: when a row or multiple rows is removed.

- vector2d::row_type: 
-- reserve: when this row is not the last.
-- insert: when the capacity is not enough and this row is not the last.
-- push_back: when the capacity is not enough and this row is not the last.
-- resize: when request a bigger size, and the capacity isn't enough and this row is not the last.
